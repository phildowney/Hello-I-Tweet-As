# Hello I Tweet As

HITA is a web app which generates name tags from a Twitter ID.  It relies on the Twitter REST API to pull public data about a given Twitter ID and create a name tag for that user.

HITA is a solution to the problem of knowing twitter names and avatars instead of real names and faces.  It was conceived of at DemoCampGuelph 9 when Sean had trouble recognizing people he tweeted with at the event.

HITA uses free and open tools. We describe our [coding practices](https://github.com/seanyo/Hello-I-Tweet-As/wiki/Coding-Practices "Hello I Tweet As Coding Practices") if you'd like to see them.

## Server-side/CLI dependencies
